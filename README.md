# Globular - Cross-implementation Lightning Network wallet

Globular is the first cross-implementation LN Android remote wallet.

It connects to [Lighter](https://gitlab.com/inbitcoin/lighter)
(develop branch), a LN node wrapper, with macaroon authentication.
Lighter is open source and can easily be self hosted.

Globular is a demo client for Lighter but can be easily extended to become a
fully-fledged wallet application.
